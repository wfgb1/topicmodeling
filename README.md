# Tweet Topic Modeling

This project explores topic modeling of Twitter data. It provides a walkthrough for identifying latent topics in a collection of tweets using unsupervised machine learning.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of the project:
- Preprocess and clean raw tweet data
- Vectorize text using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
- Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling
- Visualize top words per topic
- Interpret and label topics discovered by the model

## Why Topic Modeling?

Topic modeling helps automatically discover the themes that occur in a set of documents. In this case, it enables insights into the content of tweets without manual labeling — useful for summarizing public opinion or social trends.

## How to View

No setup is needed to explore the results — simply open the HTML file:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `Tweet_Topic_Modeling.html` in a web browser.

## Optional: Run the Notebook

If you'd like to run the notebook yourself, you'll need:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `nltk` or `spaCy` (for advanced text preprocessing)

### Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seab
